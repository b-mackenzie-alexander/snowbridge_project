The Triage Logic (For Beatrice):
The AI should be instructed to look for keywords like "doctor," "medicine," "stuck," or "oxygen" to trigger a Level 10 priority.

Final Pro-Tip for the Build:
Beatrice and Abdoul should work in the same file or a shared GitHub repo immediately. Angela and Robert, don't wait for the code—design your "Job Cards" in Figma or even on a slide so you can describe the vision if the code isn't 100% pretty by minute 45.
